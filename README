IndieCoin was first created purely as a research and test coin.

The IndieCoin will be recreated with a new blockchain and genesis block soon!

This coin will not be released until everything is ready. There will not be any pre-mining!

There are many other things to be done before-hand and the launch will only take place if everything is set.

A Windows wallet will also be made available on the launch date as well as the usual source code.

The IndieCoin will be heavily tied into the Indie Unite network (IndieUnite.com) and a range of easy-to-use methods to
add support for IndieCoin (and any Bitcoin/Litecoin based currency) transactions in games will be developed. The code
for these methods will be released as open source for verification and validation.

In the meantime, you can help by contributing some coins:
